## Guide to Contributing to the Repository 📚

### Setting Up the Repository and Cloning It

#### Initial Setup Requirements

- Install Git on your local machine (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
- Install Visual Studio Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com/>)
- Create a GitHub account if you don't have one

#### Setting Up SSH Keys

1. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows)
2. Generate an SSH key:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

3. Start the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

4. Add your SSH key to the agent:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

5. Copy your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

6. Add the key to your GitHub account:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your public key and save

#### Cloning the Repository Using HTTPS vs. SSH

##### Using SSH (Recommended)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

##### Using HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

#### Setting Up Your Local Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Configure your Git identity:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

3. Open the project in VS Code:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

#### Making Your First Commit

1. Create or modify a file in your repository
2. Stage your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

## Best Practices for Collaboration 🤝

Collaboration is key to successful teamwork, and following best practices helps
keep everything running smoothly. Below are some important practices to follow,
complete with examples to ensure effective collaboration:

### Write Commit Messages 📝

Commit messages should clearly describe what changes have been made and why.
A well-written commit message helps other developers understand the purpose of
the change and makes it easier to navigate the project's history.

**Best Practice for Commit Messages:** ✏️

- **Be clear and concise:** Briefly describe what was changed and why.
- **Follow a consistent format:** This makes it easier to read and understand.
- **Use the imperative mood:** Write messages as commands (e.g., "Fix bug"
  instead of "Fixed bug").

**Examples:**

- **Good Commit Message:**

```bash
git commit -m "Fix bug in user login validation"
```

**Explanation:** This message clearly explains that a bug in the validation
has been fixed, which helps others understand the purpose of the change.

- **Bad Commit Message:**

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed login"
```

**Explanation:** This message is vague and doesn't explain what part of the
login process was fixed or why.

**Why this is important:** Clear commit messages make it easier for your team
to understand changes without needing to dive into the code, and they make
reviewing and tracking changes much easier.

---

### Use Proper Branching Strategies 🌱

Use a structured branching strategy to ensure the team works in an organized
manner. Each new task should be worked on in its own branch, which keeps the
main codebase clean and makes collaboration easier.

**Best Practices for Branching:**

- **Create a branch for each task:** Each feature, bug fix, or improvement
  should have its own branch.
- **Name branches descriptively:** Use branch names that reflect the task
  you're working on.

**Examples:**

- **Feature Branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login-page
```

**Explanation:** You're creating a branch specifically to work on the login
page feature.

- **Bug Fix Branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-header-alignment
```

**Explanation:** This branch is dedicated to fixing an issue with the header
alignment.

- **Hotfix Branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-crash-on-startup
```

**Explanation:** A hotfix branch is used to fix a critical issue, such as a
crash when starting the application.

**Why this is important:** By creating separate branches for each task and
naming them descriptively, the team can work on multiple tasks at once without
interfering with each other's work. It also makes it easy to track what each
branch is working on.

## **Resolving Merge Conflicts 🔧**

Merge conflicts occur when two or more team members make changes to the same
part of a file. You need to resolve these conflicts manually to make sure that
all changes are merged correctly.

**Steps for Resolving Merge Conflicts:**

**Understanding Merge Conflicts** When there's a conflict, Git will mark the
conflicting areas in the file. These markers indicate the changes made by
both you and the other developer.

Imagine two developers are working on the Markdown file `README.md` or Python
file `Calculation.py`. For example, in a Markdown file:

```markdown
# How to Contribute  
This guide will help you contributing effectively.

```

In this case, the conflict is in the header (`# How to contribute`), and
both versions contain different text following the heading.

Similarly, in a **Python file**, a conflict could look like this:

```python
def greeting():
    print("Welcome to the project!")
```

### **How to Resolve Merge Conflicts** 🔧

**Steps for resolving conflicts in Markdown or Python files:**

- **Step 1: Identify the Conflict** 🕵️‍♂️
  - Look for the conflict markers. You will see:
    - `<<<<<<< HEAD`: The changes you made
    - `=======`: The division between your changes and the incoming changes
    - `>>>>>>> branch-name`: The changes made by someone else (in the
      specified branch)

**Example (Markdown conflict):**

```markdown
# How to Contribute

This guide will help you contribute effectively
```

- **Step 2: Decide which changes to keep** ⚖️
  - You need to decide if you want to keep your changes, the other person's
    changes, or merge both sets of changes.

**In the Markdown file**, you might want to combine both sentences:

```markdown
# How to Contribute

This guide will help you contribute effectively and explains the best
practices for contributing to the project.
```

**In the Python file**, you could keep both greetings or choose one:

```python
def greeting():
    print("Welcome to the project!")
    # Or, combine both greetings:
    # print("Hello, thanks for contributing!")
```

- **Step 3: Remove Conflict Markers** 🧹
  - After deciding, delete the conflict markers (`<<<<<<`, `======`, and
    `>>>>>>`). For instance, in Markdown:

```markdown
# How to Contribute

This guide will help you contribute effectively and explains the best
practices for contributing to the project.
```
